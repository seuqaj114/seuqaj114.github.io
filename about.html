  <p>I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh being supervised by Timothy Hospedales, Michael Burke and Chris Williams.</p>

  <p>My work focuses on integrating physics with deep learning from vision, with connections to control, intepretability, probabilistic modelling and reasoning.</p>

  <p>I am also a Lead Engineer at <a href="http://springbok.ai/">springbok.ai</a> where I work on projects related to computer vision.</p>

  <p>I've had stints at <a href="https://unbabel.com/">Unbabel</a>, <a href=https://thecuriousaicompany.com/>CuriousAI</a> and <a href="https://x.company/">Google X</a>.</p>

  <p>I completed my Bachelors in Physics Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, and my Masters in Artifical Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Amos Storkey.</p>
