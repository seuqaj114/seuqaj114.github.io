  <p>I'm a Machine Learning Lead at <a href=https://vcoach.ai/>vCoach.ai</a>

  <p>I'm a recent PhD grad from the University of Edinburgh where I was supervised by Timothy Hospedales, Michael Burke and Chris Williams. My work focused on integrating physics with deep learning from vision, with connections to control, intepretability, probabilistic modelling and reasoning.</p>

  <p>During my PhD I was a Senior ML Engineer at <a href="http://springbok.ai/">springbok.ai</a> where I worked on projects related to sports betting computer vision.</p>

  <p>I've had intern stints at <a href="https://x.company/">Google X</a>, <a href=https://thecuriousaicompany.com/>CuriousAI</a>, and <a href="https://unbabel.com/">Unbabel</a>.</p>

  <p>I completed my BSc in Physics Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in Lisbon, and my MSc in Artifical Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Amos Storkey.</p>
