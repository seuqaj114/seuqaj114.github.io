Having just finished my PhD in ML at the University of Edinburgh, I thought I'd share some thoughts on what it's like to be a PhD student in UK.

Note: I will leave off this post issues that seem to apply to all PhDs regardless of where they are done, such as the high rates of mental illness, publish or perish, etc.

----------------

## The Good

**State of the art research -** There's a reason thousands of the most highly qualified students in Europe and the world flock to the UK each year to pursure higher education degrees: the UK has been for a long time, and continues to be, at the forefront of research in basically every academic discipline. While some countries in Europe are strong in a few fields but not great in others, the UK has world-renowed institutions and researchers in most academic disciplines. When looking for top schools to pursue a PhD, no one says "I'm not going to the UK because there are no good research groups in my field there." Most often, they decide against it for some of the reasons I will discuss in the Bad and Ugly sections.

**English is the first language -** Another advantage of the UK has is the fact that English is the first language. This allows newcomers to integrate with the local culture and scene more easily than in non-English speaking countries (I remember going to a kickboxing class back when I moved to Helsinki, only to spend 90 minutes lost in translation because everyone, including the coach, was speaking Finnish). You understand all the signs, understand all the forms, and understand all the government websites and regulations. Also, despite what the media likes to portray, the british are overwhelmingly a welcoming bunch, and there's a level of nationality diversity that everyone seems to be used to.

**Job opportunities and salaries -** For those that choose to go to industry when the PhD is over, the UK is also a great place to stay in due to the dynamic and competitive job market. Speaking as someone who works in tech, there is no other place in Europe that simultaneously provides the same salary levels in so many innovative companies (Switzerland is perhaps the closest in job market attractiveness). London does most of the contributions here, with an outrageously large amount of companies of all sizes, from startups to big established players, constantly looking to hire new talent and willing to pay for it. The relatively low marginal income tax rate compared to other european countries is also a plus (don't look at house prices though). 


---------------------

## The Bad

**Weather -** The weather is shit, let's just get that one out of the way.

**PhD student collaboration -** In Edinburgh, the graduation requirements make it tricky to include joint-first author papers in the thesis, as the individual contributions have to be picked apart and written down explicitly. This leads to an environment that does not encourage collaboration, as a paper that comes out of the heads and hands of two PhD students in equal measure is bound to become an administrative problem down the line. In turn, this causes PhD students to rely further on their supervisors or their group's post-docs to help with guidance and brainstorming, as opposed to their own peers. I believe that allowing two students to submit content they worked on in equal measure to both their thesis would greatly improve the quantity and quality of collaborations amount PhD students. 

**Immigration -** Brexit has made the immigration requirements much less clear for both newcomers and people who are already here (from the EU). At the moment no one really knows how it will play out in the long term, but the current pre-settled and settled status solution seems to be a good middle ground between "you can come in whenever you want to do whatever you want" and "you need a visa on your passport to work here".

The fact that, even pre-Brexit, the UK wasn't in the Schengen area meant that non-EU citizens have needed, and continue to need, a Schengen visa to travel to the EU (depending on nationality of course). I have heard from a number of non-EU friends who can't be bothered doing a quick escapade to a more sunny european country because of the hassle it would be to get a Schengen visa just for a 1 week trip. As a EU citizen, I see all of europe as a free movement zone, but this is far from what non europeans experience.


---------------------

## The Ugly

**Pay and employment status -** PhD stipends in the UK are egregiously low. As of February 2022, my monthly stipend came to less than the starting salary stocking shelves at Sainsbury's (a supermarket chain). No offense to supermarket shelvers of course, but this is not what you should pay someone who is producing research for the university. And in case you're wondering, the average yearly stipend is currently at £15,285/year (these value vary slightly depending on funding body, but they are mostly low like this, with an additional bump for students in London). That's £1273 pounds per month - an absolute joke, made worse when you realise that the average entry level salary for an undergrad is around £30,000/year. This low figure has a number of nefarious consequences: 
	1) Students have to take 1 or 2 TA/marking positions to make extra cash. This isn't a problem by itself, but it would make more sense to pay more upfront and make teaching a course a year mandatory, as happens in many countries in europe, for example - if nothing else, for mental and income stability.
	2) Older students who have kids and mortgages to pay are completely priced out of doing a PhD unless they have a spouse earning enough for both of them. I don't think I need to explain why this is obviously bad.
	3) No one says it out loud but c'mon, if you pay everyone like shit, people aren't going to be as motivated as they could be, and they aren't going to treat their PhD as a real job - there's no reason for me to produce any more than the bare minimum of research needed to meet the graduation requirements, or show up every day, other than my own self pride.

Now, while we do get paid time off (nothing happens if you don't say you're on holidays and your supervisor is cool with it though, so it's a bit of an admin regulation theater), let me emphasize the fact that we are **not** employees of the university. This means that we don't get any of the benefits an employee gets. These include pension contributions by the employer and the right to unemployment benefits in case you dropout or leave the degree without a job lined up, for example. Ah, and since we're not "employed", even though we have a full time paid occupation, we can just forget about ever getting a mortgage (greatly reducing rent expenses), so we can forget the idea of renting a 1 bedroom flat for ourselves without shelling out over half of the month's income. The only benefits of student status are that we don't have to pay Council Tax (~£1.2k/year per household) and we get to use our student card to get 10% off at the burrito place.

If anything undoes the current British position as a leader in science and engineering research, it will most likely be the poor pay. Countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Denmark can offer much of the same high quality research environments, with much better working conditions and compensation, and they are bound to eat the UK's lunch. If I was heading the UKRI, I would look in this.
