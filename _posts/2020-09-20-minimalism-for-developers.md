Twitter makes me a bit miserable. Any feeling of accomplishment that I get from finishing a hard task is immediately nuked by opening Twitter and seeing what everyone out there is achieving. If you use Twitter in an academic setting you know what I'm talking about. It's like your friend's wild-holiday-in-the-jungle Facebook feed on steroids, with the added issue that it plays with your very sense of professional self worth. Since everyone is displaying their professional accomplishments, you get the feeling that you aren't accomplishing anything because _"I mean, look at this guy, another paper on arXiv???"_

I am also starting to believe (hot take ahead) that having other people's measuring stick in front of your face all the time blurs your inner compass in terms of what things you really want to achieve. To make it more concrete. Let's say you're a PhD student and your goal is to produce a small number of good papers to finish your degree, but you have no intention or ambition of becoming a serious academic with 20 publications per year. Now you log onto Twitter and you see everyone pumping out paper after paper. Suddenly (this is where the hot take begins), you feel compelled to compare the quantity of your output with others'<sup>1</sup>, and since it will most likely be inferior to that of those you follow, you start to feel like you aren't doing enough and you aren't reaching your goals. However, that wasn't even your goal to begin with! It's like saying that I feel bad for my cycling performance because of watching other people's cycling performance on Reddit, when I am not even into cycling. Dumb.

I should find some literature on this, but I believe that this constant stream of other-people's-achievements&trade; prevents you from setting a clear goal post for yourself, based on your real inner values and ambitions.

I notice very clearly that when I am logged off even for half a day, the enjoyment I draw from my work increases immensely. I become content simply with the fact that I have managed to solve some hard task regardless of whether this task would be hard to some of those people on Twitter. The inherent enjoyment of the creative and scientific process that I so love is there for my brain indulge in, but as soon as external comparisons come into the mix, all the effort and achievement seems pointless and meaningless. Maybe it's time to quit Twitter, or to subscribe to more meme accounts.
